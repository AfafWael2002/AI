# Image Classification Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for image classification using a dataset contained in `testImage.rar`. The notebook walks through preprocessing the data, building a model, and evaluating the performance of the model.

## 📁 Files

- `Age &Gender Prediction Project.ipynb`: Main notebook with the model implementation.
- `testImage.rar`: Contains the image dataset used in the notebook.

## 📌 Features

- Image loading and preprocessing using OpenCV / PIL
- Model development using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch)
- Training and validation with visual performance analysis
- Performance metrics visualization (accuracy, loss, confusion matrix)

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure to install the following dependencies before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
